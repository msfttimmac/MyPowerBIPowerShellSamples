# General Documentation: On-Premise Data Gateway PowerShell
- [On-Premise Data Gateway Management via PowerShell Blog:]( https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/on-premises-data-gateway-management-via-powershell-public-preview/)
- [Microsoft Documentation: PowerShell support for On-Premise Data Gateway:](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-powershell-support)



# Information on the different environments
Working within the different environments, there are some small items that we need to be aware of here.  I am trying to list them out as I become aware of them.

## Login-PowerBIServiceAccount
Here is the product documentation for these items:
- [Connect-PowerBIServiceAccount](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoftpowerbimgmt.profile/connect-powerbiserviceaccount?view=powerbi-ps)


| Environment | Command |
| --- | --- |
| GCC | Login-PowerBIServiceAccount -Environment USGOV |
| GCC HIGH | Login-PowerBIServiceAccount -Environment USGOVHIGH |
| GCC MIL | Login-PowerBIServiceAccount -Environment USGOVMIL |
| Commercial | Login-PowerBIServiceAccount |
| Using the Credential Parameter | Login-PowerBIServiceAccount -Credential $CredParam |

## API
| Environment | Command |
| --- | --- |
| GCC | https://api.powerbigov.us |
| GCC HIGH | https://api.high.powerbigov.us |
| Commercial | https://api.powerbi.com |

## The "Try It" Button on Microsoft Documentation Page
If your Power BI environment resides in a Government space, then the "Try It" button on the Microsoft Documentation page will not work for you.  It will always either throw a 404 or 403 type error message.  The reason is that the "Try It" button is focused on the Public (Commercial) Cloud. 

If you need to test a Rest API and in the Government Space then you will need to utilize another method, such as PowerShell and/or Postman.



# DATASET SCRIPTS / INFORMATION
## Refreshing Dataset using Rest API
- Documentation: [Datasets - Refresh Dataset](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/datasets/refreshdataset)

I did not write a script for this one, this is just an illustration of how to execute this in the different environments.  I hope that this helps you.

| **Environment** | **Command** |
| --- | --- |
| GCC |  Invoke-PowerBIRestMethod -Url "https://api.powerbigov.us/v1.0/myorg/datasets/{enter the datasetid}/refreshes" -Method Post  -Body '{"notifyOption": "MailOnFailure"}' |
| GCC HIGH | Invoke-PowerBIRestMethod -Url "https://api.high.powerbigov.us/v1.0/myorg/datasets/{enter the datasetid}/refreshes" -Method Post  -Body '{"notifyOption": "MailOnFailure"}'|
| Commercial |  Invoke-PowerBIRestMethod -Url "https://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/datasets/{enter the datasetid}/refreshes" -Method Post  -Body '{"notifyOption": "MailOnFailure"}' |


## Datasets_GetDataset_DataSource_GWInfo
**Script**: https://github.com/msfttimmac/MyPowerBIPowerShellSamples/blob/master/Datasets_GetDataset_DataSource_GWInfo
<br>
**Required**: Power BI Admin Role and possibly Global Admin<br>
**Purpose**:
This has been designed with the intention to loop through all of the Power BI Workspaces and grab all of the dataset related information.  Additionally, it will take the Dataset ID to get the DataSoruce Information.  Inside of the DataSource Information is the Gateway ID.  I utilize the Gateway ID and the Gateway PowerShell cmdlets to get the Name of the Gateway Cluster.

**NOTE**: This has been coded based on a single datasource to a single dataset.  If you have a scenario where there are multiple datasources to a single dataset, you will need to update/modify the code.

**Rest API and PowerShell cmdlets involved here**
* Admin - Datasets GetDatasourcesAsAdmin: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/admin/datasets_getdatasourcesasadmin
* Admin - Datasets GetDatasetsInGroupAsAdmin: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/admin/datasets_getdatasetsingroupasadmin
* Get-DataGatewayCluster: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/datagateway/get-datagatewaycluster?view=datagateway-ps
* Get-PowerBIWorkspace: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoftpowerbimgmt.workspaces/get-powerbiworkspace?view=powerbi-ps

## Reports_ReportInformation
**Script**: https://github.com/msfttimmac/MyPowerBIPowerShellSamples/blob/master/ReportScripts/Get_ReportInformation <br>
**Required**: Power BI Admin Role and possibly Global Admin<br>
**Purpose**:
Loops through all workspaces and lists out all reports with 
 - the created date/time and the modified date/time
 - the user: (Read Note Below)
 
 | NOTE | Currently, this script only supplies the ObjectID of the user object that created the Power BI Report.  If you desire to know more about the User in the Created BY, you will need to build more to the script utilizing the Azure AD PowerShell Modules |
 | --- | --- |
 
 
This does dump to a CSV file in the C:\Temp Directory, so you will need to ensure that you have the C:\Temp directory
It adds each record through the loop via Append.

I am using the following Rest APIs with this script through the Invoke-PowerBIRestMethod call.
 - **Admin - Reports GetReportsInGroupAsAdmin**: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/power-bi/admin/reports_getreportsingroupasadmin
 
Now I am also using the Get-PowerBIWorkspace PowerShell cmdlet: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoftpowerbimgmt.workspaces/get-powerbiworkspace?view=powerbi-ps.

## Capacity_GetCapacities_Refreshables_AsAdmin
**Script**: https://github.com/msfttimmac/MyPowerBIPowerShellSamples/blob/master/Capacity_Scripts/Capacity_GetCapacities_Refreshables_AsAdmin.ps1
**Purpose**: The goal of the script is to help Power BI Admins and/or Office 365 Global Admins pull data about their capacities and the refreshes that are occurring on the capacities. This script will loop through all capacities on a Power BI Tenant and grab the information about the refreshables and the last refresh. 

**Schema**: The schema is similar to above, but does have a few extra columns.  I will add that later on as time permits.
